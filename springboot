Spring framework: 
  Open source, create stand alone, production grade applications
  Runs on the JVM

We use spring boot to make MVC structured API

Benefits:
  Make web development fast with auto configuration -> when we build our app, it automatically gets dependencies according to configuration and avoids human error
  An opinionated appraoch to configuration-> choosing dependencies from list that is already configured
  Create standalone applications ->doesnt rely on external dependency

  spring web -> creates RESTFUL api

What problem does it solve?
Dependency injection  feature, allows defining dependencies
Allows app to be more modular
Inversion of control ->handing over control of instantiating classes to spring framework/container->creating bean i.e. instantiated object
  @Component
  @Service
  @Controller
  Has a container which stores this objects
 
Pros: Cleaner code, 
    Better decoupling of our dependencies (change in one code leads to change in another if they are tighly coupled | each method has single responsibility), testing is easier because of it
