Last friday I had to do recordshop/ diy/ pick up nieces from bicester. All of them very time consuming and could not be multitasked.

So on friday, I organized a plan which would allow me to  complete all task. I communciated to my nieces i would pick them late on friday evening and drop them back on sunday evening and made sure their parents were aware.
That meant, I could spend entire day on friday tackling record shop and get as much done as i could.
So on weekends, I oculd focus on renovating my kitchen and if needed do some runs to BNQ.
By following this plan, I had managed to get most of record shop done by friday, picked up nieces on friday evening and done diy sat/sun.
And then i dropped my nieces on time.

I have interviewed for this position in addenbrookes for 3 times and each tiem I have been rejected without feedback. I have taken the time to research those questions and how to answer them efectively online. I have spoken to seniors in my old workplace and asked them for feedback to improve my interview techniques.
Added more trainings and updated my cv. Self improvement and professional development.


Weakness: perfectionist, wont move until I get it done to the best of my ability. sometimes, takes more time than allocated
Strength: I can work well in a team and as a leader, I have attended many army training programmes and have learnt and experienced team building sessions/seminars.
